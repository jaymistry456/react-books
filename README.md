Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Interacting with the App

Once the browser renders the app, one can add a book to, edit a book in, and delete a book from the reading list. A book added will get a random image to it to be displayed.
